We include the BRK.B ticker in the Related Tickers field of the ticker listing. Where a company is delisted and the ticker is recycled; we utilise that ticker for the currently active company and append a number to the ticker of the delisted company. For example GM represents the current actively traded General Motors entity; and GM1 represents the entity that filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Where we have identified that multiple classes of shares exist for a company; we include the alternative share classes in the Related Tickers field of the ticker listing. For example we provide data for GOOGL; and you find GOOG in the Related Ticker field. This should not be considered an exhaustive list of alternative share classes.

<pre>calendardate</pre>
Entity/Calendar Date, unit: date (YYYY-MM-DD)
<br/>
The Calendar Date represents the normalized [ReportPeriod]. This provides a common date to query for which is necessary due to irregularity in report periods across companies. For example; if the report period is "2015-09-26"; the calendar date will be "2015-09-30" for quarterly and trailing-twelve-month dimensions (ARQ;MRQ;ART;MRT); and "2015-12-31" for annual dimensions (ARY;MRY). We also employ offsets in order to maximise comparability of the period across companies. For example consider two companies: one with a quarter ending on 2018-07-24; and the other with a quarter ending on 2018-06-28. A naive normalization process would assign these to differing calendar quarters of 2018-09-30 and 2018-06-30 respectively. However, we assign these both to the 2018-06-30 calendar quarter because this maximises the overlap in the report periods in question and therefore the comparability of this period.
