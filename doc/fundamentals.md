For example GM represents the current actively traded General Motors entity; and GM1 represents the entity that filed for bankruptcy in 2009\. Where we have identified that multiple classes of shares exist for a company; we include the alternative share classes in the Related Tickers field of the ticker listing.

calendardate

Entity/Calendar Date, unit: date (YYYY\-MM\-DD)

We also employ offsets in order to maximise comparability of the period across companies. For example consider two companies: one with a quarter ending on 2018\-07\-24; and the other with a quarter ending on 2018\-06\-28\. A naive normalization process would assign these to differing calendar quarters of 2018\-09\-30 and 2018\-06\-30 respectively. However, we assign these both to the 2018\-06\-30 calendar quarter because this maximises the overlap in the report periods in question and therefore the comparability of this period.
